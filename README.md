Welcome to My First Website!

This is my very first website that I've created entirely on my own as a part of my learning journey.
I've utilized the HTML and CSS languages to bring this project to life, incorporating the skills I've acquired thus far.
While it may be simple, it represents an important milestone in my journey toward becoming proficient in web development.

Thank you for visiting and witnessing my progress!
